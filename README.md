# 🎙️ Voice-Based Concept Understanding Analyser

> **An AI-powered application that evaluates a user's conceptual understanding through spoken responses using Speech-to-Text, Semantic Analysis, and Audio Feature Extraction.**

---

## 📌 About the Project

The **Voice-Based Concept Understanding Analyser (VBCUA)** is an AI-powered web application developed to assess a user's understanding of concepts through voice input. The application converts speech into text, analyzes semantic similarity between the spoken response and the expected answer, evaluates speech characteristics, and generates an overall performance score along with personalized feedback.

This project is being developed as part of the **APSCHE Google Generative AI Cloud Program**.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- FFmpeg installed and added to PATH (required by Whisper for audio decoding)
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saichaturya018/Voice-Based-Concept-Understanding-Analyser.git
   cd Voice-Based-Concept-Understanding-Analyser
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS / Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install FFmpeg** (required by Whisper)
```bash
   # Windows (using Chocolatey)
   choco install ffmpeg

   # macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install ffmpeg

   # Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

4. **Install Python dependencies**
```bash
   pip install -r "5. Project Development Phase/requirements.txt"
```

5. **Download NLTK data (first run only)**
```bash
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords
```

6. **Run the application**
```bash
   streamlit run "5. Project Development Phase/app.py"
```

7. **Open in browser**
   The app will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.
   
## 🎯 Workflow

The application follows a simple and efficient workflow for evaluating a student's conceptual understanding:

1. Launch the Streamlit application.
2. Upload the student's audio response.
3. Enter the expected answer for comparison.
4. Convert the uploaded speech into text using **OpenAI Whisper**.
5. Analyze and evaluate the response using **Google Gemini AI**.
6. Generate the similarity percentage, score, and grade based on the evaluation.
7. Display detailed AI feedback, including strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions.
8. Download a comprehensive PDF evaluation report.
